Form processing site to translate user input to Markdown style posts.

I created this after seeing an update blog on a forum where the user had used markdown to display the latest development updates. To make this easier in the future I made a site that would take user inputted data and output the formatted Markdown. This site uses [Bootstrap Framework](http://getbootstrap.com/) and Javascript.
