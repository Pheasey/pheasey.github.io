One of the second year Computing modules included a group project. This task involved a small group completing their own set brief this included planning, documentation, design and implementation.

I created an upcoming game directory site which had a forum section for each new game. Within this project I utilized Git making small, regular commits during development. I tracked my progress and set goals using GitLab issue tracking and resolution.

The site has CRUD functionality for all user based activies and a registration/login system. It uses the [fullcalender.io](https://fullcalendar.io/) and markdown packages for the previewing upcoming games and formatting in the news articles.

Created using the PHP framework [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and the CSS Framework [Bulma](http://bulma.io/).
