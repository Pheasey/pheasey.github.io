This site was created as part of my second year Web Design and Programming module which required me to design and create a relational database and website that could then be used to search through the data.

This was my first PHP project, the site uses PDO to run queries on the database. An MVC format was not used as this was taught later in the module. Only a few marks were given for CSS so I kept it rather basic.

**Search Results** with filtering and pagination.

**Arist Info Page** displaying album and track info.
