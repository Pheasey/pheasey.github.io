A coding problem set by [Elder Studios](http://www.elder-studios.co.uk/) (a web development company).

This project shaped my introduction to Laravel allowing me to get a basic grip with the framework. Following the online tutorials over at Laracasts to create a simple blog site. I then transferred these skills to tackle the Scrabble Club website. The brief and guidelines for the project are listed on the [Developer Exercise](http://www.elder-studios.co.uk/developer-exercise/) page of their site.

Version Control is something I heavily relied on with this project as I made it a priority to break down my modifications into manageable sized commits.

This site was created using the PHP Framework Laravel and the CSS Framework [Bulma](http://bulma.io/).
