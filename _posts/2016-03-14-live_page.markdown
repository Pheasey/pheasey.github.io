A gaming community hosted many knockout style tournament events which had a large community following. Many streamers would be livestreaming various matches throughout the day. For a viewer this was very confusing as the channel on which the matches were available changed depending on which streamer was assigned to it.

[Twitch.TV](https://www.twitch.tv/) only offers team pages to partnered streamers, these pages allow for multiple content creators to be displayed on a single page allowing the user to switch between them.

I created the following site so players could see which streamer was assigned which matches giving them the ability to watch the stream from the site.
